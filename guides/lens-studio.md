# Lab: Make your first Lens using Lens Studio

## Step 1: Creating a Face Mesh
1. Open Lens Studio 4.55.1
2. Create new Project
3. In the preview panel (right) change the preview to use your webcam instead of a pre-recorded video
4. In the scene hierarchy panel (top left), click + and search for "face mesh".
5. Click on Face Mesh to add it to your scene
6. Observe that a default (grey) face mesh is already applied to your face, also observe that Face Mesh assets have been added to the Resources panel (bottom left)
7. Click on "Face Mesh Default" in Resources Panel, look at the Inspector panel and observe that properties for Face Mesh are now available in this panel
8. Play around with properties such as "Base color", "Metallic", "Roughness", "Texture", until you're happy with your face mesh.

## Step 2: Importing from the Asset Library
1. On the resources panel (bottom left), click "+" and select "Asset Library"
2. The Asset Library consists of a library of thousands of assets created by members of the Lens Studio community and made available to you
3. Select the option "3D" and navigate through the assets. Choose any asset that can be used as a hat. In my example I chose the leprechaun hat.
